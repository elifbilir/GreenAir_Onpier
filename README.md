### What was done:

* I prepared test automation for checking the registration page. In first scenario(form submission-1) I send the valid data(John Doe) and send the form.
In first scenario(form submisson- 2) I send the same data with different account holder(Elif Basbug ) and checked the form

* In second scenario (form data validations) I checked the form with valid/ invalid data


To open the report you can reach the cucumber-report.html folder under the target folder
